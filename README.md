Autocorrect

A java file that takes text input into the terminal and outputs the text with corrected words.
I built this after taking data stuctures and algorthims. The concpets were interesting and I felt they could be applied. Almost every single algorithm I used was from this class.
I did this for proof of concept. It is not neat and could be more efficient.
